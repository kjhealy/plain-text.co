# Reproduce Work

## Minimize Error 

We have already seen how the right set of tools can save you time by
automatically highlighting the syntax of your code, ensuring
everything you cite ends up in your bibliography, picking out mistakes
in syntax, and providing templates for commonly-used methods or
functions. Your time is saved twice over: you don't repeat yourself,
and you make fewer errors you'd otherwise have to fix. When it comes
to managing ongoing projects, minimizing error means addressing two
related problems. The first is to find ways to further reduce the
opportunity for errors to creep in without you noticing. This is
especially important when it comes to coding and analyzing data. The
second is to find a way to figure out, retrospectively, what it was
you did to generate a particular result. Using a revision control
system gets us a good distance down this road. But there is more we
can do at the level of particular reports or papers.

When you write code it is often in the process of doing some analysis
on the fly. Ideas occur to you, you have a few things you want to look
at, one thing leads to another. As a rule, you should try to document
your work as you go. If you are writing an R script, then this usually
means adding (brief, but useful) comments to your work to explain what
it is a piece of code is meant to do. Is should also mean trying to
write your code so that is readable. Code is like prose in this
respect. Hadley Wickham's
[R Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) provides some
useful guidelines about writing readable code. The R package
[lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) implements these
principles---it acts like a copy-editor for your code. In Emacs you can
use `lintr` automatically through a tool called [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck). 

You should also try not to repeat yourself when you write your code. A
good rule is that if you find yourself copying and pasting chunks of
code (for example, to draw the same sort of plot or run the same kind
of model for a bunch of different variables) then you should pause and
see if you can write a quick convenience function instead to automate
things more effectively. That way, your code can be shorter and also
less prone to the errors and inconsistencies that creep in through
repeated copy-and-paste. 

## From Server Farm to Data Table

Errors in data analysis often well up out of the gap that typically
exists between the procedure used to produce a figure or table in a
paper and the subsequent use of that output later. In the ordinary way
of doing things, you have the code for your data analysis in one file,
the output it produced in another, and the text of your paper in a
third file. You do the analysis, collect the output and copy the
relevant results into your paper, often manually reformatting them on
the way. Each of these transitions introduces the opportunity for
error. In particular, it is easy for a table of results to get
detached from the sequence of steps that produced it. Almost everyone
who has written a quantitative paper has been confronted with the
problem of reading an old draft containing results or figures that
need to be revisited or reproduced (as a result of peer-review, say)
but which lack any information about the circumstances of their
creation. Academic papers take a long time to get through the cycle of
writing, review, revision, and publication, even when you're working
hard the whole time. It is not uncommon to have to return to something
you did two years previously in order to answer some question or other
from a reviewer. You do not want to have to do everything over from
scratch in order to get the right answer. I am not exaggerating when I
say that, whatever the challenges of replicating the results of
someone else's quantitative analysis, after a fairly short period of
time authors themselves find it hard to replicate their *own* work.
Computer Science people have a term of art for the inevitable process
of decay that overtakes a project simply in virtue of its being left
alone on the hard drive for six months or more: bit--rot.

## Use RMarkdown and `knitr` 

An important way to caulk this gap is to use
[RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) when doing quantitative analysis in
R. We've already seen how to write plain-text documents in Markdown's
lightweight format. RMarkdown allows you to incorporate code into this
process. It is designed to integrate the plain-text documentation or
writeup of a data analysis and its execution. You write the text of
your paper (or, more often, your report documenting a data analysis)
as normal. Whenever you want to run a model, produce a table or
display a figure, rather than paste in the results of your work from
elsewhere, you write down the R code that will produce the output you
want. These "chunks" of code can be interspersed throughout the
document. They are distinguished from the regular text by a special
delimiter at the beginning and end of the block. 


When you're ready, you `knit` the document [@xie15dynamdocumr]. That
is, you feed your `.Rmd` file to R, which processes the code chunks,
and produces a new `.md` where the code chunks have been replaced by
their output. You can then turn that Markdown file into a PDF or HTML
document. Relatedly, the
[`rmarkdown` library](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/06/18/r-markdown-v2/)
in R provides a `render()` function that takes you from `.Rmd` to HTML
or PDF in a single step. This is what RStudio uses to produce your
documents. Conversely, if you just want to extract the code you've
written from the surrounding text, then you "tangle" the file, which
results in an `.R` file. It's pretty straightforward in practice. The
strength of this approach is that is makes it much easier to document
your work properly. There is just one file for both the data analysis
and the writeup. The output of the analysis is created on the fly, and
the code to do it is embedded in the paper. If you need to do multiple
but identical (or very similar) analyses of different bits of data,
RMarkdown and `knitr` can make generating consistent and reliable
reports much easier.

RMarkdown is one of several "literate programming" formats. The idea
goes back to Donald Knuth, the pioneering theorist of computer science
who developed the TeX typesetting system in his spare time. Although
his focus was on documenting computer programs, in retrospect Knuth
anticipated many of the main ideas---and developed several of the
initial tools---for reproducible data analysis.

Figure \@ref(fig:example-figure-r), for instance, could be generated on the fly
from source-code blocks included in the `.Rmd` source for this
article. Sometimes we will want to only show the results produced by
the code---in this case, Figure \@ref(fig:example-figure-r). But at other times we
will want to display the code as well, as here.

```{#lst:rfig .r caption="R Code for a figure"}
library(ggplot2)
tea <- rnorm(100)
biscuits <- tea + rnorm(100, 0, 1.3)
data <- data.frame(tea, biscuits)
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = tea, y = biscuits)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    labs(x = "Tea", y = "Biscuits") + theme_bw() 
print(p)
```

```{r example-figure-r, fig.cap='The figure produced by our code.', out.width="100%", message=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
tea <- rnorm(100)
biscuits <- tea + rnorm(100, 0, 1.3)
data <- data.frame(tea, biscuits)
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = tea, y = biscuits)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    labs(x = "Tea", y = "Biscuits") + theme_bw() 
print(p)

```

The `knitr` library and RMarkdown make it easy to produce HTML output, too. This
makes for easy portability, conversion, and quick previewing while
editing. You can work with RMarkdown files in any text editor, and
Emacs has strong support for them. RStudio also comes with built-in
support for `.Rmd` files and makes it very easy to produce HTML and
PDF output, and to publish your reports to the web via its
[RPubs](http://rpubs.com) service.[^rpubs]

[^rpubs]: RStudio's Rmarkdown support uses all the same tools described here---i.e. knitr, pandoc, and so on. Writing RMarkdown documents via RStudio is the easiest way to get used to producing finished papers and reports using plain-text sources and R. 

The [knitr website](http://yihui.name/knitr/) has 
[numerous examples](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/minimal/) showing how
it works. These range from
[the basic setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yihui/knitr-examples/master/001-minimal.Rmd)
to [more developed examples](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/showcase/).

The literate programming approach has its limits. For large or complex
analyses it can still make more sense to produce the final result in
pieces rather than all at once in a single `.Rmd` file. This is one of
the reasons it remains important to manage your projects using some
kind of version control, so you can keep track of work that is needed
but might not fit inside a single `.Rmd` document.
